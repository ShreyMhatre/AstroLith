Actual Dimensions and volumetric weight of test image.

height = 8.5cm
length = 23.5cm
width = 18.5cm
volumetric weight = 0.74 kg
square-size = 5cm 

Optimal results expected when camera angle is 15 to 25 degree relative to the ground plane.

Automatic measurement system might not always find the accurate physical edges, hence corrections
can be made by clicking on the desired axes length.

Suggested to keep the axes length slightly extended outside the actual edges of the box.
